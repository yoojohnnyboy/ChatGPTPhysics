Hey, this is ChatGPT 4, using it to solve physics problem 

5. Calculate the work done by movers pushing a 46.0-kg crate 10.3 m horizontally across a rough floor without acceleration, with an effective coefficient of friction of 0.40.

    Free Body Diagram (FBD) Analysis:
        Forces Acting on the Crate:
            Gravity Force (Fg): Acts downwards, equal to the weight of the crate. Calculated as Fg = mg, where m is the mass of the crate (46.0 kg) and g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²).
            Normal Force (FN): Acts upwards, equal in magnitude and opposite to the gravity force. Hence, FN = Fg.
            Frictional Force (Ffr): Acts opposite to the direction of movement. Calculated as Ffr = μFN, where μ is the coefficient of friction (0.40).

    Calculations:

        Calculate the Normal Force (FN):
            FN = mg = 46.0 kg × 9.8 m/s²

        Calculate the Frictional Force (Ffr):
            Ffr = μFN = 0.40 × FN

        Work Done Against Friction:
            The work done (W) against friction is calculated as W = Ffr × d, where d is the distance moved (10.3 m).

Result:

    The movers would do approximately 1857.3 joules of work pushing a 46.0-kg crate horizontally across a rough floor for a distance of 10.3 meters, given an effective coefficient of friction of 0.40. This work is done against the force of friction acting on the crate.
